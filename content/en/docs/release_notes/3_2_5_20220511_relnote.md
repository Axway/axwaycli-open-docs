{{% variables/axway_cli_prod_name %}} 3.2.5 GA - 11 May 2022 is a patch release that includes improvements and bug fixes.

## Installation

```

## Improvements

* auth: When logging in using a platform tooling account (service account and username/password), validate that the platform user is a member of the same organization as the service account.
* auth: Restict platform tooling accounts from being able to switch organizations since service accounts can only access the organization for which they belong to.
* auth: Don't redirect the browser to the org selected after logging in using a non-IdP account.
* auth: Invalidate account if authentication succeeds, but fails loading to load the session details.
