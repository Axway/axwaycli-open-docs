The Axway CLI documentation is open source, and we welcome your interest in contributing to improve the quality of our documentation. Refer to our [Axway Open Docs Contribution guidelines](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/contribution_guidelines/index.html) for details. 

The Contribution Guidelines you are being redirected to are instructions specific to the Axway Open Docs repository. Make sure to follow the instructions, but apply them to the [axway-cli-open-docs](https://github.com/Axway/axwaycli-open-docs) repository and not the [axway-open-docs](https://github.com/Axway/axway-open-docs) repository.
